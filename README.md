# Advent of Code 2019

## Notes

The code is organized into 

```
src/
 lib.rs  <-- Just exists to allow other files to access util.rs
 util.rs <-- Actual util library
 bin/    <-- Solutions live here, organized by day
```

Each file has tests and a main function. Running main will output the answer for each puzzle.
